# Crop-Production-Prediction-in-India
The aim of this project is to develop a machine-learning model to predict crop production in various regions of India. This prediction will be based on factors such as the state, district, crop type, season, area under cultivation, crop year and production. Accurate predictions can assist farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding agriculture planning, resource allocation, and crop management.
